  <h2>Hey there, sunshine!</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to my little yarn-filled nook of creativity on the internet!!! Iâ€™m Bella, and I'm delighted to introduce you to Loop de Loops â€” a place where tangled yarn balls turn into beautiful art, and every stitch is made with a whole lotta love (and probably a snack break or two).  
    I started crocheting as a tremendously bored ten year old, and luckily the hobby stuck! 
    I've continued this lovely craft because everyone needs something soft in a world that can feel a little rough sometimes. While crocheting and its creations can't fix everything, there's a world of wonder, love, and joy to be unlocked in the art! Over the years, it has grown into a joyful chaos of overly colorful yarn, vintage vibes (the cool way to call myself a premature grandma!), and creations that look like they belong in your favorite children's book!  
    Here youâ€™ll find handmade pieces that are cozy, quirky, and sometimes a little lopsidedâ€”but thatâ€™s part of the charm, right?
     I believe in crafting with love and care always, laughing often, and making things that feel like hugs - joining three of my favorite things!! 
    Whether youâ€™re here to snag a gift for someone you love (yourself included!), looking for a pattern, or just scroll while wrapped in a blanket and avoiding your responsibilities (no judgment), Iâ€™m so glad youâ€™re here.  
    Youâ€™re welcome to stay as long as you like. Just donâ€™t be surprised if you leave with glitter in your hair and a sudden urge to crochet a mushroom.  
    Sending you lots of hugs hugs and tons of smiles!!! ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ
